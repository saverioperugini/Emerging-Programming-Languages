<h3>An Implementation of the Minimax Algorithm with Connect Four in Kotlin</h3>

<h3>Ajay J. Patnaik</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>
</center>
<blockquote>
This paper presents a system that uses artificial intelligence to play a game of Connect Four. With more than four and a half trillion possible board combinations, the amount of system memory needed would be intractable. Using a depth constraint, we can reduce the amount of computations and memory needed. The artificial intelligence algorithm selected for this system was the minimax algorithm, using an alpha-beta heuristic. The algorithm looks through all of the possible board states, up to the constraint, and returns the next best move. With this implementation of the minimax algorithm, you can play a game of Connect Four against the artificial intelligence with varying levels of difficulty.
