</center>
<blockquote>
  This is a hash verifier in linux/unix.
  The purpose of this utility is to be able to tell whether a file has been changed since the hash was created.
  This command line tool is written in Kotlin with Gradle as a dependency manager.
  Gradle allows us to integrate with tons of existing plugins.
  The plugin used for this CLI is picocli, which is an annotation based CLI framework.
