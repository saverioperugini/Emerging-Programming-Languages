<h3>A Super Smash Brothers Tournament Locator in F#</h3>

<h3>Tyler P. Berkshire</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>
</center>

<blockquote>
A worldwide tournament locator for one of Nintendo's popular video game series, Super
Smash Brothers, is implemented in the F# programming language. The system is deployed as a web
application and utilizes the Fable F# compiler to convert the ecosystem into React and
JavaScript elements. Our application is structured with the Elmish architecture's "model
view update" style in mind and uses Webpack to bundle its modules. The tournament data is
retrieved from smash.gg's GraphQL API with API queries implemented in Python.
