<h3>N-Queens Puzzle in Kotlin</h3>

<h3>Corey J. Reichel</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>
</center>
<blockquote>
Puzzles such as eight spaces or queens games are useful for testing 
the efficiency of a given algorithm in which there is an exhuastible 
domain. These puzzles are good models to develop algorithms that have 
applications to various domains in computer science~\cite{ayub}. With 
these types of puzzles minimizing search space dramatically improves 
performance and memory usage as the size of the problem increases. We 
demonstrate valid solutions to Queen's game on varying size boards with 
different types of algorithms using lazy evaluation and depth first 
search algorithms in Kotlin. Starting from simple brute-force algorithms 
that merely guess and check, to more refined algorithms such as depth-first 
and look-ahead that attempt to trim the search space by eliminate unnecessary computations.
