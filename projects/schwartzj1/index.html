<h3>Kotlin Mobile Application for PC Control</h3>

<h3>Jacob T. Schwartz</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>
</center>
<blockquote>
We present a PC remote Bluetooth control application implemented in the Kotlin programming language for Android. Using the Android Bluetooth library, the mobile application communicates with a local server running on a client PC to interact with it’s operating system and perform actions such as volume control, custom keystrokes, turning off or rebooting the device, and more. The client server runs on Kotlin, utilizing the languages ability to interoperate with the Java programming language to utilize Javax’s Bluecove library to communicate with the client machine’s Bluetooth adapter. This is the only option to write a Bluetooth server on any desktop operating system, as the only native Kotlin library for Bluetooth communication, at this time, works exclusively on the Android operating system; Android, nor its fork to create Internet of Things devices (Android of Things) are capable of running alongside major operating systems.
