<h2><hr align="left" width="40%"/>Key language concepts in Factor
<hr align="left" width="40%"/></h2>
<ul>
<li> Factor = Object-Oriented + Functional + Stack Balancing</li>
<li> Factor is an object-oriented language that utilizes functional programming execution and
a stack based data flow to create powerful and expressive programs. [FDSL]</li>
<li> Developed by Slava Pestov, a Russian-American programmer who now works at Apple developing
the Swift programming language.</li>
<li> Heavily influenced by Forth, the progenitor concatenative and stack-based programming language [ABIF].</li>
<li> Factor's name comes from the belief that 'factoring out' common basic functions is necessary
and useful for expressive concatenative programs.</li>
<li> In the concatenative tradition functions are idiomatically called <b><i>words</i></b> and 
collections of words are called <b><i>vocabularies.</i></b></li>
<li> Higher order words called <b><i>combinators</i></b> are essential to minimizing 
code definitions.</li>
<li> All values are objects and objects share <b><i>generic words</i></b> that serve a role
similar to template functions in other languages.</li>
<li> Types are generally enforced only by whether or not a given generic word
is defined for the given object's class.</li>
<li> The combination of simple syntax and strict rules for managing the stack encourage the
programmer to write terse and specific code.</li>
<li> Overall, Factor demands that the programmer take responsibility for errors with
a 'let it crash' philosophy.</li>
<li> Factor is a general purpose language that is deeply tied to its development environment
and features a wide range of mature vocabularities for a variety of use cases.</li>
</ul>

<h2><hr align="left" width="40%"/>
Core Factor
<hr align="left" width="40%"/></h2>
<ul>
<li>Short and expressive words are always the goal</li>
<li>Combinators are encouraged where applicable</li>
<li>Stack shuffling is useful but should be minimized</li>
<li>Stack effect is required for documentation and practical reasons</li>
<li>Objects do not own their own methods, but can have member variables</li>
<li>Derived classes are easily obtained through simple set theory operations</li>
<li>Generic words encourage safe and effective code reuse, even across classes</li>
<li>Lazy evaluation is present, such as the <tt>[a,b]</tt> word that produces 
a promise of a range on a to b</li>
</ul>

<!-- Concatentative Programming -->
<h2><hr align="left" width="40%">
Concatenative Programming
<hr align="left" width="40%"></h2>
A <b><i>concatenative</i></b> programming language operates by
concatenating smaller programs (or functions) together
to create a new program. [CPLW]<br/>
<ul>
<li> Similar in concept to filter pipelining in Linux/Unix.</li>
<li> Evaluations occur by concatenating several functions that all operate
on a single piece of data that is transformed along the way.</li>
<li> To fit this paradigm, functions in Factor are called <b><i>words</i></b>,
and the space character is not-so-jokingly called the <b><i>concatenation operator</i></b>.</li>
</ul>
For example, consider the following program, which computes the factorial of 10:<br/>
<pre>
10 [1,b] 1 [ * ] reduce

--- Data stack:
3628800
</pre>
The number 10 is taken from the stack, used to generate an array of range 1 to 10, and finally reduced 
through product multiplication applied to all of the elements.<br/>
This form of programming fits well with filter pipelining heavily used in Linux/Unix. 
Consider the following program that collects capital letters from a character array:<br/>
<pre><tt>{ "T" "E" "s" "T" } [ upper? ] filter

--- Data stack:
{ "T" "E" "T" }
</tt></pre>
<!-- End of Concatenative Programming -->

<!-- Stack Based  -->
<h2><hr align="left" width="40%">
Stack-Based Programming
<hr align="left" width="40%"></h2>
A <b><i>stack-based</i></b> programming language loads operands onto a data stack. Words that
use the operands <b><i>pop</i></b> operands from the stack and <b><i>push</i></b> back
the results.<br/>
<ul>
<li> This is separate from the stack reffered to from the realm of memory allocation.</li>
<li> The data stack is a 'global' region, but scope is effectively introduced through the concept of <b><i>stack effect.</i></b></li>
<li> The data stack may be manipulated using certain words, such as <tt><b>dup</b></tt> that duplicates the item on the top of the stack,
or <tt><b>swap</b></tt> which swaps the top and second-from-top items.</li>
</ul>
For example, consider the following Factor sequence that evaluates <tt>(1 - (2 * (3 + 4)))</tt>:<br/>
<pre>
IN: scratchpad 1 2 3

--- Data stack:
1
2
3
IN: scratchpad 4 + * -

--- Data stack:
-13
</pre>
<!-- End of Stack-Based -->

<!-- Stack Effects  -->
<h2><hr align="left" width="40%">
Stack Effects
<hr align="left" width="40%"></h2>
A <b><i>stack effect</i></b> is a part of a word declaration in Factor that serves for both documentation and very basic argument pattern matching.
<ul>
<li> Stack effects are declared using the '<tt>( input ... -- output ... )</tt>' word composition.
<li> All defined words must include an explicit stack effect declaration.</li>
<li> Stack effects are checked during compilation of code and produce errors when ignored.</li>
</ul>
Consider the following formal definition of a factorial function:
<pre>
: fact ( n -- n! ) [1,b] 1 [ * ] reduce ;
</pre>
The stack effect '<tt>( n -- n! )</tt>' above notes that a item 'n' at the top of the stack 
will be consumed and replaced by an item 'n!'.<br/>
(Remember that arbitrary characters have no special meaning without surrounding spaces.)
<br/>
<!-- End of Stack Effects -->

<!-- Stack Checker  -->
<h2><hr align="left" width="40%">
Stack Checker (Error Detection)
<hr align="left" width="40%"></h2>
The <b><i>stack checker</i></b> is a tool built into the Factor Listener that additionally checks for and enforces consistency
in the execution of words.<br/>
Specifically, the stack checker ensures that words with branching control flow have the same
general stack effect across all branches.
<ul>
<li> In practice, this means that a word will always leave the stack at the same height after execution.</li>
<li> Pestov and the other authors argue that stack-checking is necessary to reduce the chance for hard to detect bugs
 caused by inconsistent stack effect.</li>
<li> Additionally, without stack checking it is easy for the programmer to miss edge-case conditions during unit testing.</li>
</ul>
<!-- End of Stack Checker -->

<!-- Stack Shuffling -->
<h2><hr align="left" width="40%">
Stack Shuffling
<hr align="left" width="40%"></h2>
Data stacks have a unique challenge when it comes to visualizing the hierarchy of data throughout a program.<br/>
In some situations the programmer will find that they need to reorganize items on the stack in order to 
accomplish some task.<br/>
For instance, consider the following function which determines if <tt>a</tt> 
is a multiple of <tt>b</tt>:<br/>
<pre>
: multiple? ( a b -- ? ) swap divisor? ; inline
</pre>
This word takes advantage of the <tt>divisor?</tt> word to determine multiples. After all, if <tt>a</tt> is a 
multiple of <tt>b</tt> then <tt>b</tt> must be divisible by <tt>a</tt>.<br/>
In order to use this straightforward observation the word '<tt>swap</tt>' is used to swap the pair of items on the top of the stack, giving the 
<tt>divisor?</tt> word a whole new implication.<br/>
Some common stack shuffling words and their stack effects are:
<ul>
<li><tt>swap ( x y -- y x )</tt> simply swaps the two topmost items on the stack.</li>
<li><tt>dup ( x -- x x )</tt> duplicates the topmost item on the stack</li>
<li><tt>drop ( x -- )</tt> removes the item on the top of the stack.</li>
<li><tt>nip ( x y -- y )</tt> removes the item just below the topmost stack item.</li>
<li><tt>over ( x y -- x y x )</tt> duplicates the second item from the top and places it on the top.</li>
</ul>
<!-- End of Stack Shuffling -->

<!-- Combinators -->
<h2><hr align="left" width="40%">
Combinators
<hr align="left" width="40%"></h2>
<b><i>Combinators</i></b> are higher-order words that take other words as arguments and apply theme
to the data stack in a unique way.<br/>
Some common combinators include:
<ul>
<li><tt>dip</tt> takes a word as an argument, saves the topmost item of the stack, applies the word to the remaining stack,
and then returns the saved element to the top of the stack.</li>
<li><tt>bi</tt> takes a item off the stack and two additional words. It then applies the word to each item, resulting
in two separate results that are placed on the stack.</li>
<li><tt>tri</tt> extends <tt>bi</tt> by applying three words to a given item, resulting in three items in the stack.</li>
<li><tt>cleave</tt> is the ultimate extension of the previous words, taking an unbounded number of words and leaving an
unbounded number of results.</li>
<li><tt>reduce</tt> takes a list, an accumulator, and a word, and applies the word to each element of the list,
adding the result of each cycle to the accumulator.</li>
<li><tt>map</tt> takes a list and a word and produces a new list obtained by applying the word to each element of the
original list.</li>
<li><tt>filter</tt> takes a list and a predicate and returns the items of the list that successfully match the predicate.</li>
</ul>
<!-- End of Combinators -->

<!-- Combinators -->
<h2><hr align="left" width="40%">
Quotations
<hr align="left" width="40%"></h2>
<b><i>Quotations</i></b> are anonymous functions in Factor that can be used as arguments for
various combinators. <br/>
<ul>
<li>Quotations are denoted through the use of the <tt>[</tt> and <tt>]</tt> parsing words.</li>
<li>Like defined words, quotations must have consistent stack effects for successful compilation. </li>
<li>They may be partially applied through the a specific syntax. For example,
<tt>10 '[ _ = ]</tt> produces the quotation <tt>[ 10 = ]</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<!-- End of Quotations -->

<!-- Combinators -->
<h2><hr align="left" width="40%">
Vocabularies
<hr align="left" width="40%"></h2>
<b><i>Vocabularies</i></b> are collections of words, similar to libraries and namespaces in other languages.<br/>
<ul>
<li>Vocabularies made by the user are traditionally placed in the <tt>work</tt> Factor subdirectory.</li>
<li>Each vocabulary must explicitly reference any other vocabularies they rely on in their header.</li>
<li>They may include words that are labeled private, but the user can still use these words
by asking for the private word collection explicitly.</li>
<li>With explicit referencing Factor vocabularies are only included and compiled when needed, allowing for
exceptionaly compact deployed programs compared to some other languages.</li>
</ul>
<!-- End of Quotations -->

<!-- Combinators -->
<h2><hr align="left" width="40%">
Classes
<hr align="left" width="40%"></h2>
Factor is a object-oriented language where every value is an instance of an object. Factor has three types of classes:
<ul>
<li><b><i>Primitive</i></b> classes are used for basic data, such as numbers, strings, and others. These classes
may not be subclassed.</li>
<li><b><i>Tuple</i></b> classes are more complicated classes that support instance variables.</li>
<li><b><i>Derived</i></b> classes are classes that stem from a specific tuple class.
Derived classes can be divided into smaller subgroups, such as <b><i>predicate</i></b>, 
<b><i>union</i></b>, and <b><i>intersection</i></b> classes.</li>
</ul>
A unique result of Factor's object-oriented implementation is that classes do not own any intrinsic words.<br/>
This means that objects are fully separated from the words that operate upon them and their variables.<br/>
Instead, <b><i>generic words</i></b> are used. Generic words are defined to operate on a wide number of classes.<br/>
New definitions for a new class are provided by the programmer. Generic words are thus comparable to template class functions in other languages like C++.
<!-- End of Quotations -->

<!-- Development Workflow -->
<h2><hr align="left" width="40%">
Development Workflow
<hr align="left" width="40%"></h2>
Factor programs are written and evaluated through an interactive development environment called the <b><i>Factor Listener</i></b>.
<ul>
<li>Source code and vocabularies are compiled into a program image.</li>
<li>The running state of Factor can be saved into an image file and restored for easy access at a later time.</li>
<li>This gives the language the performance benefits of compilation as well as some of the flexibility of an interpreted language.</li>
<li>The <b><i>scaffold</i></b> vocabulary is available for easy generation of source code files. </li>
<li>The documentation of Factor is built into the interface through a button on the Listener.</li>
<li>Basic tools also exist for supplying new documentation for custom words, vocabularies, and classes from within the Listener.</li>
</ul>

<h2><hr align="left" width="40%"/>
Exercises
<hr align="left" width="40%"/></h2>

The following are some programming exercises that incorporate some essential
Factor concepts:

<ul>

<li> Define a word <tt>caesar</tt> in a vocabulary <tt>homework</tt> that
takes a string of alphabetical characters and an integer and applies the
integer to each character in the string.  Your solution must handle both
positive and negative offset values. Only include uppercase and lowercase
alphabetical characters in the output. For example, <tt>ABCD</tt> with an
offset of 4 should produce <tt>EFGH</tt>. Factor your solution into a primary
word <tt>caesar</tt> and set any helper words as private. This problem can be
solved in less than 10 lines of code.

<br/>
<br/>
Examples:
<br/>

<pre>
> "SEESPOTRUN" 26 caesar .
"seespotrun"

> "SEESPOTRUN" -26 caesar .
"seespotrun"

> "ABCDEFG" 7 caesar .
"HIJKLMN"
</pre>
</li>

<li> Define a new tuple class <tt>novel</tt> that represents a fictional
literary work.  Include member variables that correspond to the novel's title,
author, genre, publisher, year of publication, and an identification number.
Use strings for the first four variables and integers for the last pair.
Include a constructor <tt><novel></tt> that takes values for each variable as
arguments and sets them automatically. Also include a word <tt>book-print</tt>
that takes a novel as an argument and prints the novel's details in the
following simple format:

<pre>
Class: Novel
Title: < title >
Author: < author >
Genre: < genre >
Publisher: < publisher >
Year: < year >
ID: < number >
</pre>

Examples:
<br/>

<pre>
> "Narnia" "C. S. Lewis" "Fantasy" "Harper-Collins" 1952 1 <novel>

--- Data stack:
T{ novel f "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" "C. S. Lewis" "Fantasy" "Geoffrey Bles" 1950...

> book-print
Class: Novel
Title: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe
Author: C. S. Lewis
Genre: Fantasy
Publisher: Geoffrey Bles
Year: 1950
ID: 1
</pre>
</li>

<li> Extend the solution to problem 2 to two new classes of books -
<tt>textbook</tt> and <tt>article</tt>. For textbooks, change the 'genre'
field to 'subject'. For article, change the 'genre' field to 'discipline' and
add 'journal' and 'volume' fields.  Then, with the three classes, define a
<tt>mixin</tt> class called <tt>library</tt> that will represent the union of
different types of books. Adjust the <tt>book-print</tt> word from before to
be generic with templates for each type of book. Publish the <tt>library</tt>
and each class in a <tt>library</tt> vocabulary.
