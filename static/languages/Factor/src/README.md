# Factor Examples

These vocabulary examples are supplemental to ["An Introduction to Factor"](../Factor.pdf).

## Vocabulary Usage

The example files and folders provided in this directory are Factor vocabularies.
Factor vocabularies should typically be placed within the Factor working directory.
By default this is the `<factor>\work` subfolder located within the Factor installation path. 

## Example 1 - Private Helper Words

The `caesar` example demonstrates usage of private helper words.

To test the `caesar` vocabulary start a new Factor Listener session and submit 
`USE: caesar` to the listener. If successful the listener will continue with no 
errors. If an error occurs check to make sure that the `caesar` 
vocabulary folder is within your working path.

Once accessed, the `caesar` word may be used by supplying the proper arguments 
to it upon the stack. For example, submitting `"abcdef" 6 caesar` should result in 
`"ghijkl"` on the stack.

```factor
USE: caesar
"abcdef" 6 caesar
```

## Example 2 - Class Constructors & Words

The `novel` example demonstrates a simple class constructor and a method that
operates on the class.

To test the `novel` vocabulary start a new Factor Listener session and submit 
`USE: novel` to the listener. Once accessed, the `novel` constructor word may be used by 
supplying the proper arguments to it upon the stack. The `<novel>` word expects strings 
representing a title, author, genre, publisher, and integers representing a year of 
publication as well as an identification number, as in the following example: 
`"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" "C. S. Lewis" "Fantasy" "Geoffrey Bles" 
1952 1 <novel>`.

When executed the `<novel>` constructor will leave a `novel` on the stack. To print
the details to the listener terminal use the `book-print` word.

```factor
USE: novel
"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" "C. S. Lewis" "Fantasy" "Geoffrey Bles" 1952 1 <novel>
book-print
```


## Example 3 - Mixin Classes & Generic Words

The `library` example showcases the `mixin` feature to implement class unions, as well as
the way to define class-specific implementations of functions.

To test the `library` vocabulary start a new Factor Listener session and submit 
`USE: library` to the listener. Once accessed, the `library` provides definitions for the 
`novel`, `article`, and `textbook` classes. These classes have similar arguments to the `novel`
mentioned above. Specifically, the `article` changes the genre field to discipline and adds 
journal and volume fields. The `textbook` field changes the genre field to a subject.

When executed the `book-print` word will operate on any instance of a `library` object.

```factor
USE: library

"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe" "C. S. Lewis" "Fantasy" "Geoffrey Bles" 1952 1 <novel>
book-print

"The C Programming Langauge" "Ritchie, D. and Kernighan, B." "Computer Science" "Prentice Hall" 1988 2 <textbook>
book-print

"Factor: A Dynamic Stack-based Programming Langauge" "Pestov, S." "Computer Science" "ACM SIGPLAN Notices" 45 "ACM Press" 2010 3 <article>
book-print

```
