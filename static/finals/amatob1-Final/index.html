<h3>Concurrent Implementation of the Fast Fourier Tranform in Koltin</h3>

<h3>Luc V. Talatinian</h3>

<b>Abstract</b>
</center>
<blockquote>
We present an implementation of the Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform algorithm in the Kotlin programming language. 
The Cooley-Tukey algorithm structure, which partitions the input into two parts and recursively solves each partition,
lends itself to parallelism. Kotlin's coroutines allow for the introduction of concurrency with minimal additional code 
through it's async and await operators. The utility of the FFT is shown by comparing the Discrete Fourier Transform, 
Fast Fourier Transform, and Concurrent Fast Fourier Transform when finding the power spectra of an audio file.
