Create an extension of the Int data type. Inside that, create a method that allows you to multiply the value by two. Then show that you can use it by declaring and initializing an integer and then using the method to multiply it by two.

extension Int {
    mutating func multTwo() {
        self = self * 2
    }
}

var an = 5
an.multTwo()
